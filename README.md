## Pie and Pry Tutorial Session

### Monthly event for potential students and curious minds as an introduction to Ruby basics and debugging tools.

### Ruby is the language first introduced to students during their journey at Flatiron. “Pie & Pry” is a way to build the foundation necessary to enhance proper debugging techniques specific to Ruby but will also translate to other languages. “Binding.pry” in particular allows students to pause their code during runtime and allows them to inspect behavior / functionality. We are introducing useful tools immediately from the start because growing comfortable with using these tools is key to successfully starting a career as a developer. 

### The following topics / concepts will be covered:

#### What is a pry session and why is it important?
#### How do you use pry and what are the ways to instantiate a pry session?

#### Defining variables and accessing them within: 
##### 1. Pry session
##### 2. Method
#####      a. What is a method? 
#####      b. What is an argument? 
#####      c. Can you pry within a method? 
#####      d. How do you call a method? 
#####      e. What data types can you pass into a method? (string v. array v. integer) 
#####      f. Iterate over an array using its indicies. Will pry hit during each iteratiom?
