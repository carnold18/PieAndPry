## *Pie and Pry Tutorial Session*

_Monthly event for potential students and curious minds as an introduction to Ruby basics and debugging tools._

***

*Ruby is the language first introduced to students during their journey at Flatiron. “Pie & Pry” is a way to build the foundation necessary to enhance proper debugging techniques specific to Ruby but will also translate to other languages. `Binding.pry` in particular allows students to pause their code during runtime and allows them to inspect behavior / functionality. We are introducing useful tools immediately from the start because growing comfortable with using these tools is key to successfully starting a career as a developer.*

### The following topics / concepts are covered:

#### What is a pry session and why is it important?
#### How do you use pry and what are the ways to instantiate a pry session?

***

#### Defining variables and accessing them within: 
- Pry session
- Method
- What is a method? 
  1. What is an argument? 
  2. Can you pry within a method? 
  3. How do you call a method? 
  4. What data types can you pass into a method? (string v. array v. integer) 
  5. Iterate over an array using its indicies. Will pry hit during each iteratiom?
